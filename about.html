        <!--Write my bio here-->
        I am Marco Duran, currently in my pursuit of a Bachelors Degree in Interactive Media and Game Development at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and plan on graduating this Fall.
        My career goal is to be a game developer or software engineer related in audio technologies.
        In my spare time, I am a drummer and backup vocalist in the band Knights of the Basement. I also enjoy playing Rhythm, RPG and Sandbox video games.

        Throughout my time at WPI, I have also participated in quite a few game jams and have begun work on a side project to be released soon called <a href="http://osmorrow.com"><i>Osmorrow</i></a>.
        I am a team oriented person and have been a part of multiple leadership positions. I am also a project member on the two award winning projects for the 2017 WPI IMGD Department: <i>Step Symphony</i> and <a href="http:www.velumgame.com"><i>Velum</i></a>.
