            <p>
                <b>Purpose and Accomplishments:</b> This game was a group project for the final assignment in IMGD 3000 "Technical Game Development 1" course taught at WPI.
                This game was developed in a custom game engine called the Dragonfly. This version of the engine has sounds and procedural generation.
                I created the music and sound effects in the game. I also wrote the pathfinding aspect, monster stats and classes, as well as item stats and classes.

                <b>Game Description:</b> Rock Lives is a survival game in which the player must defeat a horde of monsters while traveling through a rocky pass.
                When the player initiates play of the game he is given control of his avatar which will be referred to in game as a “Wanderer” He is then be placed in the game world to explore.
                The game world consists of a 2D grid of ASCII Characters. The world is made of an array of monsters, items, and environment tiles.
                The environment has two different types of tiles, walkable and unwalkable. Unwalkable tiles are represented by mountains.
                The goal of this game is to survive as long as possible until the player is defeated in battle by one of the monsters or starves to death.
                Along the way, the player will be able to find new weapons and armor to make the wanderer stronger. There are also items that heal, feed, and increase the strength of the wanderer.
                After defeating a foe the Wanderer may level up increasing the base stats of the character.
